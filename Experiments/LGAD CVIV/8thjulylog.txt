We start 0916 by measuring on TILGAD 2022-152 2 C1-V3-1TR A


procedure:

Put the LGAD on the chuck,
Put vacuum on the chuck so LGAD sits still,
Get needles to contact,
Close lid,
Let in dry air, 
load proper settings in labview program,
start measurement!

(actually the very first measurement was not getting that error, but the voltage range was just weird)

measurements:
09:40: first try we are getting bad compliance on the power supply (above 20 micro amps)
09:45: tried adjusting the pad needle, but getting same error (on the total current)

10:00: Now put on the TILGAD_6 152 4 C1 V3 1TR B, pixel=00
Same error :(

Trying to restart the labview software
It works! So maybe be careful with starting the labview program without having the current measurers on (maybe weird connection issues?)
Now the problem is that it didn't go through the fine voltage range, so we try to input another file of voltages to go through

10:28: we adjusted the voltage range so it doesn't go above 70V because that's where the TILGAD starts breakdown, and it works nicely for the total current.
But it seems like the pad has contact
Trying pixel 11 now: Same bad pad contact, it just hovers around some noise level 0.1 picoA

We will try a normal LGAD now, just to sanity check if the IV measure

So, using PPS_LGAD_02, which is "FBK UFSD4 W18 GR3_1 T10 6-4", a 5x5, measuring on pixel=44
Ok so this one had to be cooled down to minus 20 degrees, which took some time.
11:15: starting measurements and it looks good!
11:22: Now doing a measurement on a bigger voltage range to see the all the behaviour
It's looking good



Now we wanna do CV measurements:

First do a measurement where the needles/probes aren't connected to anything. It does something like subtract a background.
Do this over a decent range of frequencies, like 100Hz, 1000Hz, 10000Hz.
100Hz: oops didn't write down in time! :p
1000Hz: C=5.0765E-11, G=3.4771E-10
10000Hz: C=5.072E-11, G=1.92E-9

So we tried to do CV measurements but we just got Labview connection errors. I'm thinking it might be because I didn't connect the pad properly, so that the LCR meter saw weird things and thus gave out errors.

12:37: We are now heating the LGAD up again, and will see if we have time to measure on a TI LGAD 5x5 before we get lunch maybe, or something?
We got one good IV measurement which didn't have the full range though.
Trying to make another IV curve just gave the issue that had been met before:
The pad current went very quickly (at like 5V) to the compliance (50uA).

We will try again tomorrow, by grounding the nearby pads of the 5x5's
