14:38  We want to measure on the wirebonded TILGAD_AIDA 5x5, doing IV curves, stopping well before pixels break.

Measuring on pixel 04 first

We are slowly using the software compliance to see if we can measure the IV curve at safe-ish current levels

We are hitting compliance very early. The 250uA compliance only allows us to reach 11V, so we can't see the gain layer turn on.
We will try pixel 44 just to see. Same

We removed the extra grounding 50ohm terminators, and got slightly different results. The current seems to maybe stabilize close to 25uA?
Without the grounding we can measure an IV curve as with the non-wirebonded ones. Maybe it's the 50ohm terminators that were dominating the current ealier?

Now just grounding one connector (pixel 33) by connector J9
I get the same as before, so no extra total current. Maybe it's just when the broken pixel is ground that there is a lot of extra current?
We grounded everything but the broken pixel (00), and we get nice IV curve same as before

15:42: We want to reproduce the effect, so we just connect the broken pixel to a 50ohm termination again
It hit the compliance (of 100uA) at 6V already, so it seems reproducible. 

So: If we ground a broken pixel with a 50ohm termination, then the total current in the LGAD is much higher.
