This afternoon we want to maybe do some more destructive tests on the TI LGAD from AIDA (the wirebonded one).
We grounded all pixels except the broken pixel 00 with 50ohm terminations

So it works now!

We first did a few short tests, hitting compliance. We then let it slowly go above the 65V breakpoint (compliance at 500uA). 
We stopped the measurement at 70V.

We are now going to do a complete IV curve up til 100V or 500uA, whatever comes first, and then probably measure on other pixels also.

At around 73V it hit the compliance very suddenly. The software compliance was measuring values around 410uA, and then suddenly it hit the hardware compliance.
The padcurrent on the sourcemeter shows 3.2nA, and on the sourcemeter it shows 1.38 mA

So the 44 pixel doesn't seem broken itself, but now there is much more total current in the chip. We hit 500uA at around 15V
We will now test to see if one of the pixels is broken

OK
