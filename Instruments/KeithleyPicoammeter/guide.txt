Here is a link to a guide to install gpib stuff

https://gist.github.com/ochococo/8362414fff28fa593bc8f368ba94d46a

OK THERE MIGHT BE AN ERROR IN THAT LINK!
In this part:
""
Instal the user part:

cd ~/linux-gpib-code/linux-gpib-user
sudo make install
""

You should maybe instead do 

""
cd ~/linux-gpib-code/linux-gpib-user
./bootstrap
./configure
make
sudo make install
""

I don't think the PyVisa part is needed for this program to run. I couldn't get pyvisa to install correctly so I just use the gpib library.

In order to use several gpib usb controllers your "gpib.conf" in /etc/ needs to be like:

interface {
        minor = 0
        board_type = "ni_usb_b"
        pad = 0
        master = yes
}

interface {
        minor = 1
        board_type = "ni_usb_b"
        pad = 0
        master = yes
}

And so on for more controllers

On computer turn-off then turn-on, I for some reason need to run

sudo gpib_config

(This only targets minor=0 by default)

If you have several USB gpib controllers then you need to specify by writing

sudo gpib_config --minor 0

and

sudo gpib_config --minor 1

before I can talk to the keithley picoammeter.
But after running that it all works. 

The program needs to be called as sudo, since gpib needs sudo permission (for me at least), which also means (for me) that I had to install the various python packages as sudo. So for example

sudo pip install pyqt5
sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install pyqtgraph

And so on.

Once everything works, you should be able to run the program with

sudo python3 instrumentcontrol.py
