Today is the day where we want to measure on the last 5x5 TILGAD, which is wirebonded. We have a working setup which we will just be testing real quick before we start

09:35: We have a non-TI LGAD connected to the measuring setup, and we will just do a quick IV curve to see that all is well.


TI-LGAD AIDA1 (the wirebonded one)
Measuring on pixel 00 first
10:38: The TI-LGAD is also a light detector, but not as good. Current in the range of 50 nA
We'll now add a little bit of voltage and just see what happens
At 1V we already get like 15 uA

10:47, now measuring on pixel 11. We just tested up to 3v, and the pad current was very low so it seems to be not broken.

Now testing pixel 22, which we expect to be broken: Ok so that one doesn't seem to be broken, interestingly.

11:00 Ok so the plan now is just to do non-destructive tests on the TI-LGAD

Pixel 33 also seems to be fine.

Pixel 44 also seemed fine.

Pixel 04 also looked to still be good

Now for the connected pixels:
J2: Seemed fine
J3: Seemed fine also
J6: Was fine
J7: Was fine

11:29: Just testing one last time on pixel 00. Reconfirmed that it is probably broken.

I now want to do good measurements on all the outputs from the wirebonded non-TI LGAD, since those measurements can be used as comparison 
for when we get the irradiated ones wirebonded.
