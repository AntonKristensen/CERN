Ok this will be the first time we try measuring on wirebonded LGADS with my own setup.

It's 15:33 and we will try on a non-TI LGAD 

We found out that we could measure light by not applying bias but still measure a current. The current was at about a microamp, but went 
down to the nanoamp level once we covered it by a bag and a rag.

We then slowly measured the response to bias, looking at the total current, and it seemed quite decent, so we did an IV curve which turned out to look like a good IV curve!
