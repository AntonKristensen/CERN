09:06: Good morning! We are setting up the equipment, and then we want to measure on the 2x2 TILGADs correctly.
The error yesterday was that we were confused about which pads to contact, so we had used the cutouts for laser measurements.
The pad on the 2x2 TILGADs is almost the entire surface of the pixel

We will first measure on PPS_TILGAD_06, "2022_152 4 C1-V3-1TR B"

09:24: Started the IV measurement, hit compliance at 20uA at like 90V
It happened again with 40uA, so doing a finer scan on lower range voltages

So the first measurement on pixel 11 was very nice, got a slight bump of pad current at very low voltages (like 5V)
The next measurement on pixel 01 had a very strong pad current at around 5V, but otherwise the data (on manual inspection) seemed fine (hard to read from labview graph). This might be similar to the problems we see on the 5x5s?
Then measuring on pixel 00, same weak early bump, but otherwise looks like an IV curve. It didn't hit compliance, so we also get a downwards curve, and it seemed that there was positive current at like below 25V (so below the gain layer depletion).
09:46: now measuring the last pixel IV curve, so pixel 10. Same slight bump at 25V before gain layer depletion.

Similar for all the pixels on this lGAD is that there is some wonky stuff going on at around 25V. It seems there might be some interesting stuff with the depletion or something? Could be interesting to study this with very fine voltages and see if it is systematic.

09:53: now we wanna do CV measurements on the same chip
First doing open contact CV measurement:
100Hz: C=5.065E-11, G=4.27E-10
1000Hz: C=5.065E-11, G=4.27E-10
10000Hz= C=5.071E-11, G=3.51E-10

Getting connection errors now
So I can actuallyh make it work by having the "open connection" button pressed, so it doesn't REALLY seem to be connection issues...
It works when trying to measure on 10kHz, but the CV curve is really quite flat, almost just constant at 4.6 pF
Tried again at 5kHz, getting similar results.
10:45: I will adjust the voltage steps a bit so it's quicker to do a measurement, and so we can maybe see a similar behaviour of the CV curve as what has been previously seen from non trench-isolate LGADS.
OK NICE! We got something that totally looks like a CV curve! The capacitance is low, and the change in capacitance after the gain layer has been depleted is not very dramatic, but it is very clear to see! 
The first measurement was on bottom left pixel, so 00
10:50: Now measuring same 10kHz CV on top left pixel, so 01. First try looks like a slightly bad pad connection. Ok retried the pad connection and looks good now!
10:58: Now measuring on pixel 11, looks good so far
11:03: Last measurement on the bottom right pixel, so 10.


11:24: We have cooled down the same chip to -20 degrees celsius, and now we want to repeat at least some of the CV and IV measurements, to see if there is any difference
The first CV run seems like it had a bad pad connection. Ok so in hindsight that measurement at 10kHz had like 5 points with values around E-12F, so it seems like it must be possible to get good values.
11:32: Now trying an IV run just to see if stuff is still connected. The IV actually looks fine-ish?
Now we will try CV at lower frequencies, since they gave slightly higher capacitances, so maybe the signals will be better?
11:38: 5kHz didn't really work, but it seems 2kHz works nicely! No the curve is still wonky, and the equipment gives timeout error when measuring above 60V.
ys
We are changing various parameters like signal amplitude and frequencies just to see if something physical happens, but we are just not getting anything that seems nice

12:07: We will now be heating it up to see if it makes it work.
Ok we do a CV measurement on -10 degrees celsius and it looks really good! We got a timeout error though, so the data is not saved, but at least I took a photo of the graph.
Trying again at -10C just to see if it works.
Ok we managed to get a CV curve by cutting off points ater 27V. Not ideal, but we also measured an IV curve that goes to 80V so we have the breakdown

12:28: Now measuring IV and CV at 0C. 
The IV curve is kinda weird for the voltages below gain layer breakdown
The CV at 0C looked good also

12:50: Since there were a few good points in the very first CV measurement at -20C the thought is that maybe the probe just didn't have good physical connection. Like maybe it contracted because of the cooling and thus lost its contact.
So now we tried to make it press down harder on the LGAD pad, so that the connection should be stronger. We're cooling down to -20C.

-20C IV curve looks good. Stopped at 80V because of 40uA compliance.
Yup, CV curve works!
So We did one more IV, and then one more CV, and now just doing a Cv after that CV, just to check if we need to make IV before CV. Doesn't seem like it though!
